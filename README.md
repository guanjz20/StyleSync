### [Project](https://hangz-nju-cuhk.github.io/projects/StyleSync) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05445.pdf) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuBglL2KGFc) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAPDl2dVonY)

We propose **StyleSync**, an effective framework that enables high-fidelity lip synchronization. We identify that a style-based generator would sufficiently enable such a charming property on both one-shot and few-shot scenarios.

## Code
Inference script and model code have been released. 

## Run Generation
The decision to suspend the release of the model weights has been made by our team based on various considerations. At present, I also do not have a specific expected date for its release. However, if you are interested in utilizing our demo for academic purposes, such as conducting a comparison in your paper, please don't hesitate to contact me by [guanjz20 at mails dot tsinghua dot edu dot cn].
